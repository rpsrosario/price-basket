#
# The catalog.list file describes the list of all of the items available in our
# imaginary store. It is read on a line per line basis adhering to the following
# rules:
#
#   1. A catalog entry contains the name of the item followed by its price in
#      GBP per unit (1.50 being Â£1 and 50p)
#
#   2. Whitespace is ignored except when between text segments (in which case
#      any amount of whitespace is perceived as a single space character)
#
#   3. Entry names are case-insensitive (so Apples is the same as APPLES)
#
#   4. Duplicate entries are prohibited
#
#   5. Comments are ignored (lines starting with #).
